# MinimalistFox

MinimalistFox is my personalized version of Bento. I changed it to fit my style better and make it look nicer.

## By the way...

I only modified how it looks. It remains a homepage for my Firefox browser, functionally unchanged from the [original version by migueravila](https://github.com/migueravila/Bento?tab=readme-ov-file). The core functionality is the same. For instance, I added a pop-up and glow effect to the buttons, but they're still just clickable buttons.

## Features

- 🛠️ Easy to set up.
- 🌓 Switch between light and dark modes easily.
- 🎨 Customize how it looks.
- 💬 Add your own greetings.
- 🎨 Change colors and font sizes.
- 🔵 Uses Lucide icons for visuals.
- 🧩 Uses modular JavaScript files.
